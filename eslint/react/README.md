This is the shared configuration for React projects.  It is a pretty thin wrapper around
[`create-react-app`'s default config](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-react-app)
and [AirBnB's React-based config](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb).
Note that this adds support for Typescript and Flow, as well as the
[`jsx-a11y`](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) accessibility plugin.
