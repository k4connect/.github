tsconfig Files
==============

These are files that configure Typescript for various environments.

Environments
===============

The environments that are supported are the `*.json` files in this directory, except (of course) for `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.  The `node.json` file supports all current
Node LTS versions.

If you are looking for a browser environment, my suggestion is to use the most recent Node environment and then use [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) with [`@babel/preset-env`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-preset-env.html) to transpile the code generated by Typescript.

Usage
=======

First, install the exact latest version of `@k4connect/tsconfig` as a `devDependency`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev --save-exact @k4connect/tsconfig
```

(The `--save-exact` is so that you don't upgrade your configuration by accident.)

Now create a `tsconfig.json` file as a sibling to your `package.json` file. It should look like this:

```json
{
	"extends": "@k4connect/tsconfig/<your-env>.json"
}
```

You will probably want to modify/overwrite some of the values that are provided. If so, just update your `tsconfig.json` values [as per the Typescript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig). I especially suggest taking a look at [`include`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#include), [`compilerOptions.rootDir`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#rootDir), and
[`compilerOptions.baseUrl`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#baseUrl).


Development
===============

The environment-specific JSON files can be generated by running `npm start`.  If you make any modifications to how the files are generated, be sure to run `npm test` to validate that they work.
Once that's done, bump the version number and do `npm publish`.
