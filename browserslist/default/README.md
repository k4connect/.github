Default Browserslist Configuration
========================================

This is the configuration that exports our supported environments for all environments.  It is the broadest compatibility layer that we have, useful for libraries and other environments where
you want to ensure maximal compatibility.

See the `README.md` file that is up a directory for details about how to use this.
